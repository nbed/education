        <p>The school improvement committee is responsible for supporting the principal and engaging school personnel to conduct the school improvement process, including all of the components listed above with the exception of the establishment of the committee.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In addition to the components listed above, the role of the school improvement committee is to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Conduct the annual self-assessment across the four domains of school improvement (Systemic School Planning, Collaboration, Teaming and Leadership, Learning Environments, and Classroom Practice), while making links to the objectives of the 10-year Education Plan.</li>
        <li>Identify a few key goals.</li>
        <li>Ensure the establishment of strategies and actions to address identified goals.</li>
        <li>Report to the school principal and/or designate and other stakeholders on the progress of the school plan.</li>
        <li>Collate and analyze the evidence required for the Annual School Progress Report.</li>
        <li>Assist with the development, authoring and distribution of the Annual School Progress Report.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note the school-wide goals are very broad. There should be alignment of the school-wide goals with the associated strategies and actions enacted at each level within the school. As we progress from schools, to teams, to classrooms and then to individual students, the strategies and actions, as well as the data used to measure progress, become more targeted.</p>
        <p>The following diagram illustrates that the vision and mission are broad concepts that identify the preferred reality and the broad potential steps which personnel could take to advance outcomes. As we move from broad improvement goals and overall school strategies, we become more targeted. Team and individual strategies and actions should support diverse school goals aligned with the vision and mission of the school. The most targeted actions should occur at the individual student level and should be designed to accomplish two tasks: advance overall school goals and, most importantly, address the needs of the diverse clients (individual students) that we serve.</p>

        selected: false,
        content: html`<p>The improvement team should be collaborative and operate in an interdependent manner with stakeholders and potential partners. Although often grouped together and sometimes overlapping, there are often marked differences between stakeholders and partners.</p>
        <p>A <strong>stakeholder</strong> is defined as &ldquo;any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization&rsquo;s objectives&rdquo; (Freeman 1984)<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>. More recently, when defining the term, proponents of change theory have included those who feel they have or will be influenced by an institution (Initiatives Management, EECD, 2017).</p>
        <p>Friedman and Miles (2006)<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> provide an exhaustive list of those who may be considered stakeholders. The main groups include customers/clients (students), employees, local communities, suppliers and distributors, and shareholders. Additionally, Friedman offers the media, the public in general, business partners, future generations, past generations (founders of organizations), academics, competitors, NGOs or activists. In addition, stakeholder representatives from trade unions or trade associations, financiers, competitors, government, regulators and policymakers could be considered.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The school administrative team and improvement committee members should work to identify potential <strong>partners</strong> and actively seek opportunities to communicate with and engage community members, organizations (non-profit), businesses, and other governmental and non-governmental agencies for potential partnerships and support. Many of these partnerships could provide school and community groups with some mutual benefit. For example, students taking Cooperative Education 120 could work with a seniors&rsquo; facility to support online learning for residents as part of their Co-op placement. Opportunities such as these provide practical learning experiences for students while also benefitting the institution hosting the student. It is important that potential partnerships between school and community, which provide the opportunity to advance student outcomes, be examined.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Regardless of the partner or stakeholders, it is important that team structures are established to promote effective two-way communication between the improvement team and groups with an interest in the improvement plan. To ensure this occurs, improvement teams should solicit feedback from partners and stakeholders prior to generating the plan. Once the improvement plan has been developed in draft form, it is important to communicate the plan to stakeholders for feedback, revisions and support as needed. One goal of this activity would be to examine opportunities for stakeholder support and options for additional partnerships. To accomplish this, schools should:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Provide a copy of the plan to all relevant stakeholders. (See <a href="#_Appendix_C:_Sample">Appendix C</a> for a sample improvement planning template.) This would include teachers, para-professionals (EAs, SIWs, administrative assistants, etc.), external partners, family representatives, District Education Council (DEC) and Parent School Support Committee (PSSC) members.</li>
        <li>Ensure the plan is reviewed at a staff meeting with all staff present. It is recommended this staff meeting take place at the beginning of the school year. During the meeting, demonstrate the alignment of the plan with district and departmental goals, the 10-year Education Plan objectives, and team or teacher growth goals as appropriate.</li>
        <li>Have the improvement planning team or school leaders present the improvement plan to the PSSC and request feedback.</li>
        <li>Consider including a copy of the plan on the school's website. This action may facilitate opportunities for further partnerships.</li>

        content: html`<p><em>The District <br /></em>The work of the district will include helping to promote a culture of self-assessment, evidence-based inquiry and collective responsibility for continuous improvement at district, school and provincial levels. To do this effectively, districts must be collaborative, inclusive and respectful when working with schools. This necessitates a focus on equitable practices while recognizing the distinct nature and needs of each school. Reciprocal communication should be open, honest and focused on a process used primarily for supporting continuous improvement.</p>
        <p>The district processes should:&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Support the notion of continuous improvement for schools and districts.</li>
        <li>Support capacity building and autonomy at the school level.</li>
        <li>Support the self-assessment process at the school level and provide assistance to schools who may need assistance to effectively self-assess.</li>
        <li>Recognize the uniqueness of each school, and work to support the strategies undertaken to address the goals and advance student outcomes.</li>
        <li>Where needed, district staff (school liaisons and/or critical friends) will help schools develop a deeper understanding of the self-assessment process and the evidence which may be used to effectively self-analyze.</li>
        <li>The school liaison can either act as a critical friend or help facilitate links to critical friend(s).</li>
        <li>Critical friends will work with school personnel in a constructive, non-threatening manner.</li>
        <li>Share high level information (e.g., high-level content derived from the schools&rsquo; annual progress reports) to Education and Early Childhood Development (EECD) to help inform long-term provincial planning, goal setting, professional learning and the allocation of supports.</li>
        <li>Support a cycle that helps align the school, district and provincial planning cycles (e.g., three to five years and/or alignment with the 10-year Education Plan).</li>
        <li>Support actions which help reach the objectives identified in the 10-year Education Plan.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>School Liaisons/Critical Friends<br /></em>Many of the specific roles and responsibilities of the district staff were previously outlined in this document with the exception of the <em>school liaisons</em> and <em>critical friends</em>. The school liaison is a designated person at the district level who will link schools to critical friends or to act as the critical friend. Critical friends act as a coach, facilitator or challenger and are used to help schools identify needs and build capacity. According to the Glossary of Educational Reform,</p>
        <p class="block">&ldquo;A critical friend is typically a colleague or other educational professional, such as a school coach, who is committed to helping an educator or school improve. A critical friend is someone who is encouraging and supportive, but who also provides honest and often candid feedback that may be uncomfortable or difficult to hear. In short, a critical friend is someone who agrees to speak truthfully, but constructively, about weaknesses, problems, and emotionally charged issues.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>See: <a href="https://www.edglossary.org/critical-friend/">https://www.edglossary.org/critical-friend/</a></p>
        <p>Schools may suggest others to act as critical friends, including colleagues working in like-sized or configured schools, working on similar initiatives or challenges, or those identified by the district using promising or exemplary practices in improvement planning, gathering and analysis of evidence, and ongoing monitoring of progress. District personnel acting as critical friends may refer principals, school administrative teams or improvement committee members to others who have expertise or experience in an area identified as a school improvement goal.&nbsp;</p>`,
